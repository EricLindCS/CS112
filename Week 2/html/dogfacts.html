    <h3>Dogs! Some people love them, and other people are allergic to them. </h3>
    <p>Dogs are really the best pet you can have, and here's why! They are kind, caring, extremely capable of learning, and able to do many jobs for society!</p>
 
 <p>Dogs can be there for you even when people can't. They offer unconditional love, emotional support, and constant cuddles that help stave off social isolation. <br> It's been scientifically proven that that dog ownership even helps to reduces loneliness.</p>

      <h4>Here are the top 5 reasons everyone should have a dog!</h4>
      <ul>
            <li>A dog will clean up your kitchen floor when you drop food</li>
            <li>A dog is a great exercise partner</li>
            <li>A dog can make you feel safer in your own home</li>
            <li>A dog will be incredibly loyal to you and your family</li>
            <li>A dog will provide seemingly endless love back to you!</li>

      <h3>The Age-Old Debate: Cats vs. Dogs</h3>
</div>

<div class="Section3">
      <p>You might say that cats are a better pet than dogs, but that is just wrong!</p>
      <a href="https://pethelpful.com/pet-ownership/10-Most-Common-Pets-In-The-US">Dogs really are the best, surveys have shown dogs are the most popular pet in America!</a>
      <p>Dogs are more trainable, use the bathroom outside, can protect you, and promote a more active lifestyle. <br> Having a dog has many benefits that make it better than having a cat. <br><br> Although, it is possible to think one is better than the other but still love both.</p>
