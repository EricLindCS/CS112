      <p>You might say that cats are a better pet than dogs, but that is just wrong!</p>
      <a href="https://pethelpful.com/pet-ownership/10-Most-Common-Pets-In-The-US">Dogs really are the best, surveys have shown dogs are the most popular pet in America!</a>
      <p>Dogs are more trainable, use the bathroom outside, can protect you, and promote a more active lifestyle. <br> Having a dog has many benefits that make it better than having a cat. <br><br> Although, it is possible to think one is better than the other but still love both.</p>
