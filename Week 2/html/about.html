<h1>My Dog: Mocha</h1>
<h4>
 <p>Mocha is 7 years old, and my family rescued her from the Best Friends LA animal shelter in 2017.</p>
 <p>She is a mix of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Cattle_Dog">Austraulian Cattle Dog</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border_Collie">Border Collie</a>.</p>
 <p>She loves to run, play, and learn new tricks.</p>
 <p>She especially loves to shake (hands? paws?) <br> in exchange for treats!</p>
 <p>She always has lots of energy, and loves to go on walks every morning and in the car with her family.</p>

<h1>My Dog: Lillie</h1>
<h3>
<p>Lillie is 3 years old, and my family rescued her from the West LA Animal Shelter in 2019</p>
<p>She is a mix of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Cattle_Dog">Boston Bulldog</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border_Collie">Pitbull</a>.</p>
<p>She loves to meet new people, and get attention.</p>
<p>She also loves to give kisses to people and jump up on them, pretending she is a lapdog.</p>
<p>Her favorite toy is a tug toy she can use to play with Mocha or me.</p>
