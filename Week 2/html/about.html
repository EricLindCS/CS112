      <h3>Why do I love dogs so much?</h3>
</div>

<div class="Section1">
    <p>My family has owned dogs since I was born, and that's why I love them so much!</p>
    <p>My first dogs were a dog named Barkley, and a dog named Snow my parents had adoped before I was born.</p>
    <p>Snow was a couch-potato lovable <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akita">Akita</a> and Barkley was a hyperactive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labrador">Black Labrador</a>.</p>
    <p>I loved them very much, but unfortunately Snow passed away in 2011 and Barkley in 2015.</p>
    <p>After that, my family adopted <a href="index.html#Mocha">Mocha</a> in 2016 and then <a href="index.html#Lillie">Lillie</a> two years later as a birthday present for my sister, and my love of dogs has never had cause to falter!</p>
