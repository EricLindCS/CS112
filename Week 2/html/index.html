    <h3>Dogs! Some people love them, and other people are allergic to them. </h3>
    <p>Dogs are really the best pet you can have, and here's why! They are kind, caring, extremely capable of learning, and able to do many jobs for society!</p>
 
 <p>Dogs can be there for you even when people can't. They offer unconditional love, emotional support, and constant cuddles that help stave off social isolation. <br> It's been scientifically proven that that dog ownership even helps to reduces loneliness.</p>

      <p>Here are the top 5 reasons everyone should have a dog!</p>
      <ul>
            <li>A dog will clean up your kitchen floor when you drop food</li>
            <li>A dog is a great exercise partner</li>
            <li>A dog can make you feel safer in your own home</li>
            <li>A dog will be incredibly loyal to you and your family</li>
            <li>A dog will provide seemingly endless love back to you!</li>
      </ul>

<h1>My Dog: Mocha</h1>
 <p>Mocha is 7 years old, and my family rescued her from the Best Friends LA animal shelter in 2017.</p>
 <p>She is a mix of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Cattle_Dog">Austraulian Cattle Dog</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border_Collie">Border Collie</a>.</p>
 <p>She loves to run, play, and learn new tricks. </p>
 <p>She especially loves to shake (hands? paws?) <br> in exchange for treats!</p>
 <p>She always has lots of energy, and loves to go on walks every morning and in the car with her family.</p>
